This is a Code Editor just like CodePen and w3schools editor.
We can run HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT using this small editor.
I made it just for learning purposes.
Feel free to use this code anywhere.
Just download the Zip floder and open in your favourite code Editor(vsCode, sublime, Atom).
Write the code in seprate sections and Run via button down below.
The Run Button Compiles your whole html css javascript code and shows desired output on output screen in the right.

Thank you...
